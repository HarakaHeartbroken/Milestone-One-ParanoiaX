// placeholder for story web/scripting


// initial- RPS game, with extra command for "exit" and more explicit command list options
// on exit, load page- render(map), pc = new Player, etc

// Player starts locked in a hallway, theres a door, a console, a red beam fence, and some interactibles
// console allows you to ask for several things
// door is just a prompt that "Retreating is TREASON, Citizen!"
// and kills you
// For purposes of Demo, "you can't die until you've completed your mission, you'll be
// executed for every clone lost after this point until you finish your mission."
// Just count negative clones left as a joke, maybe a full win if you have positive lives left
// Real game, you have 6 clones to begin with, can gain credits during/for each mission, 
// can use credits to buy clones and random stuff/meta game



// asking to turn the fence off is above your clearance and knowing that is above your clearance
// you can ask for food, mercy (killing), etc, basically all unhelpful and occasionally...
// lethal stuff
// all dropped items can be clicked on or ran over to add to inventory
// clicking on an item in inventory (stretch keyboard/arrow control) offers USE options
// LOOK, USE, DROP, EAT, whatever
// Think old Sierra Adventure games

// Solution 1- ask for Limon-Lem Bouncy Bubble Beverage, which is YELLOW
// pour/rub/use BBB on self, coloring self YELLOW
// walk through the fence

// Solution 2- ask for food
// wait until the Infrared/robot delivery person comes, they'll turn off the field, walk in,
// drop FOOD, leave, turn the field back on. Just walk out when the fence is off, no one
// cares.

// Solution 3- Check the loose panel to the left side of the wall, leave the cell through 
// the hole. 

// False solution, rub oil on self to turn suit INFRARED, laser is RED clearance and 
// Friend Computer will happily remind them of that


// any way, there's an interactible door at the far end of the map, leads to the win screen
// in the demo, leads to another map/story/challenge in the full game
