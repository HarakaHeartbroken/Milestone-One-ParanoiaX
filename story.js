// initial- RPS game, with extra command for "exit" and more explicit command list options
// on exit, load page- render(map), pc = new Player, etc

// Player starts locked in a cell, theres a console, a red beam fence, and some interactibles
// console allows you to ask for several things
// asking to turn the fence off is above your clearance and knowing that is above your clearance
// you can ask for food, mercy, etc

// Solution 1- ask for Limon-Lem Bouncy Bubble Beverage, which is YELLOW
// pour/rub/use BBB on self, coloring self YELLOW
// walk through the fence

// Solution 2- ask for food
// wait until the Infrared/robot delivery person comes, they'll turn off the field, walk in,
// drop FOOD, leave, turn the field back on. Just walk out when the fence is off, no one
// cares.

// Solution 3- Check the loose panel to the left side of the wall, leave the cell through 
// the hole. 


// either way, there's an interactible door at the far end of the map, leadsa to the win screen



// Eventually lead to "You needed to get the RPS module out of the console, you'll know
// which console, it's in the room with the broken fence."
